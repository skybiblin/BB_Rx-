# BB_Rx-
This is the model I am using for the most part. https://bbolker.github.io/mixedmodels-misc/glmmFAQ.html
I included the datasheet that has all of my plot totals. 
The example RMD is for stand density (#trees/plot). I plan to use the model to examine other q's in relation to absense/presense of Rx fire. 
If you can get an understanding of GLMM and follow the RMD example when I get back we can go through some of the other variables together. 
Here are my research questions I will eventually get to. Did prescribed fires improve stand resistance to wildfire?
Severity e.g. mortality (may be problematic to interpret bc rx fire may have already lost some trees. Maybe not problematic to interpret bc HIGH severity)
Remaining density or basal area (total or per species)
Canopy cover e.g. canopy retention (are trees healthy?)
Char height
Did prescribed fires improve stand resilience to wildfire?
Number basal sprouts
Number of seedlings 
Epicormic sprouts
Did prescribed fires influence invasive species establishment? 
Did prescribed fires promote native understory diversity? 


Did prescribed fire improve resilience to future wildfires ? Did prescribed fire reduce risk of catastrophic forest loss from a repeat wildfire? 
Fuel
Ground fuel (activity)
Aerial fuel (standing dead)
Stand structure 
Basal area/plot 
Density (trees/plot)

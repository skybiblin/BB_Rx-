# BB_Rx-
This is the model I am using for the most part. https://bbolker.github.io/mixedmodels-misc/glmmFAQ.html
I included the datasheet that has all of my plot totals. 
The example RMD is for stand density (#trees/plot). I plan to use the model to examine other q's in relation to absense/presense of Rx fire. 
If you can get an understanding of GLMM and follow the RMD example when I get back we can go through some of the other variables together.
